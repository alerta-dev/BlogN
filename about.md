I'm a software engineer from the US, I've previously lived in California, Ohio, and Seoul, and I currently reside in New York City. Hopefully by the time you read this that info is out of date! I love breathing in new people, places and things. 

I consider myself a code craftsman. Writing elegant code is a joy to me. I work in Go right now. In the past I have written a lot of Java, JavaScript and MySQL. In the future I'd like to get more experience with Kotlin and TypeScript.
