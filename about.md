Hi, I am Madhur, a Senior Software Engineer at Myntra. I mostly do back-end development and a teeny tiny bit of front-end. I love to start learning new things (well, in some cases yes, just to start). I mostly work with Java for back-end development and with Python for scripting.

Have dabbled in a couple of things in the past, Editing, Illustration, Graphic Design, Video Editing, Digital Painting, Piano, Front End Dev, Reading and of course currently obessed with certain parts of back-end dev.


Working to improve inventory at [Myntra](myntra.com). Trying to build small things, one of them being [UtliTea.in](utilitea.in) ☕
