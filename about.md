I'm a software engineer from the US, I've lived in Ohio and Seoul, and I currently reside in New York City. Hopefully by the time you read this that info is out of date! I love breathing in new people, places and things. 

I consider myself a code craftsman, and I take pride in my work. I love writing code and I hope to be doing it for a long time. I work in Go right now. In the past I have written a lot of Java, Javascript and MySQL. In the future I'd like to get more experience with Kotlin.
