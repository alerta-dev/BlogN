The following is a excerpt I found valuable from [Dival Banerjee's article in Master Plan](https://masterplan.substack.com/p/master-plan-dival-banerjee-vuecason). I highly recommend reading his entire article, as its on his efforts building a combined metal printer and machine tool at his startup [vuecason](http://www.vuecason.com/).

## To learn quickly, skip the fundamentals
Start with what you currently know, then go deep when you encounter problems. Most people would say to start with the fundamentals, but I disagree. This is one area where I’m the exact opposite.

Fundamentals matter, but most people don’t understand them thoroughly without hindsight. For some people, learning the fundamentals upfront works really well, and they’re able to determine when to use which thing. For me, I need to just work on it. It’s also a lot more fun for me that way.

Obviously, you should know the bare minimum of the fundamentals first. I wouldn’t say to learn calculus, but everything up to that you’ll have to know to at least get started. And then it’s really a process of learning how to learn.

If you can learn quickly, you don’t need to rely on the fundamentals. Go ahead and try making something that fails. Try to understand why it fails. If you don’t understand why it failed, that’s a great place to start digging deeper and look for the root cause and figure out what actually went wrong.

Over time, you will learn the fundamentals just by doing work, and often better because you’ll know the context to use each tool. In a physics textbook, you can learn all the laws and equations, but if you notice, most of the problems for each chapter are just small variants of three or four different problem archetypes.

In the real world, many problems are too complex to model compared to the problem archetypes that you’re taught in textbooks. You have to go deeper to get a better understanding.

## An example of the process

My recommendation would be to find a way [(like an online tutorial)](https://hackaday.io/) to build what you want to build. After that, figure out ways to improve it. 

Let’s say you want to build a drone, and you didn’t learn any of the theory behind how drones work. You didn’t do any calculations, and you didn’t sit through a university course on physics.

Go ahead and build it. Build the drone. And then try to get it to take off and fly. Most likely, it won’t work. The next step is to start asking yourself a ton of questions.

-   Why isn’t the drone taking off?
-   It’s going at full throttle, the propeller is spinning, but there’s no lift. Why is that?
-   Are the motors providing enough thrust?
-   Is the drone too heavy?
    

And finally, if you keep Googling random stuff, you’ll eventually come across the idea of [thrust-to-weight ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust-to-weight_ratio). And you start to ask yourself: what is the minimum thrust-to-weight ratio needed to let my drone take off?

That’s when you learn the basic physics equations. You’ll realize, “Oh, I have to make sure the force due to thrust has to exceed the force due to gravity to make the drone go up.”

It’s not a hard calculation, but you still need to learn how to calculate that number. You’d end up repeating this process several times for various things, but after lots of mistakes, you’ll have a functioning drone. On the other hand, if you try to learn all the fundamentals, like physics and controls first, you can spend 40 hours reading textbooks and still have no clue what you’re doing.

A lot of times, it’s really important to know when to use something, rather than just how to do it. Using calculus as an example, you don’t need to know how to actually integrate. You just need to know when to use it, then you can throw it in the calculator. You shouldn’t be doing that by hand anyway. You need to know when to use which tool, and the best way to learn that is by applying it in context.
