Hello, World!

For the longest time, I have wanted to have a personal site. Why? To be honest I don't really know, but it feels nice to just have someplace to jot down your thoughts. Have some sort of place to update on things that I am working on, and to have some sort of accountability.

To be honest, I don't know how long will I continue to post here, but hope to post with a little but consistency.
